    <h2>Tom and Jerry are not who they portray themselves to be.</h2>
    <h3 style="font: built titling;">Many believe that Tom and Jerry were actually very close at one point. Please see the evidence:</h3>

    <h2> .... Interesting..........</h2>

    <h3>Everybody knows that you don't kiss people you don't like. Judging by this snapshot of them in their 1960s style of animation, this image was most lakely taken in Tom and Jerry's old days.</h3>
    
    <h4>We must also look at other aspects. Something most looked over when watching Tom and Jerry is the dynamic between a mouse and a cat.
    When an anonymous supporter asked Google if a cat can easily kill a mouse, Google responded with the following:</h4>

    <img src="file:///C:/Users/kevin/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_20221201_012330.png" style="border: 2px solid;">


<h4>As you can see the answer is yes. Not only that, but Google has even let us know that they don't usually eat their kill, meaning Tom is most likely faking his desire to eat Jerry.</h4>
<h4>So the real question is... </h4>
<h4>If Tom and Jerry used to be friends and aren't friends anymore, why doesn't Tom just easily eat Jerry? Could it be because...</h4>
 
<ol>
    <li>He's hungry?</li>
    <li>He's messing around?</li>
    <li>He's bored?</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0); font: 1em gimme danger;">NO.</h2>


<h4>As you can see below, there is a side of the story that no one knows..</h4>

    <h3>Tom and Jerry have a history that most do not know about. Many believe that Tom is actually a mouse and that Jerry was simply malnourished.</h3>
    <h3>Raised in the same nursing home, Tom and Jerry were treated diffrently. Tom was always given more attention and nourishment simply cause he looked cooler.</h3>
    <h3>Out of jealousy, Jerry always messes with Tom, and Tom plays along because he feels bad and empathizes with Jerry's anger.</h3>
